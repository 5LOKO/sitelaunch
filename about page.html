5LOKO is a five-piece Art Pop band based in South Florida, New York, and Puerto Rico consisting of members Raf, Jesus, T, Este, and Bin. 
They broke through into the ether of indie music in October 2020 with their debut EP, "2009", with the project and subsequent singles garnering them an initial wave of hundreds of fans. 
In July 2023, 5LOKO released their debut album, "New Beatles": a ten-track collection of standalone songs that serve as pop-packaged portals into sonically-varied worlds of emotions, feelings, and memories. 
The band has been shouted out by the internet's most influential music critic, Anthony Fantano of The Needle Drop, for their "New Beatles" single "mushrum", as well as featured in Latin-American music publication, Remezcla, for their song "New York City Art Kids". 
Their entirely self-made music videos have gathered thousands of views on YouTube, each providing fluorescent DIY visions of their respective songs, and showcasing the band's signature style of cheeky humor. 
The visual and musical style of the world of 5LOKO is a sprawl of cultural and artistic influences pulled from the entire history of popular American music; an art pop synthesis rooted in the foggy-eyed nostalgia of childhood and translated through subsequent years of life experience, heartbreak, sorrow, and ecstasy. 
5LOKO's music is future-minded - fusing both singing and rapping as coexisting non-genred means of expression and using familiar sounds/feelings to pull listeners into an unfamiliar version of our current reality, one where summer is never-ending yet melancholic, and where it's okay to dance, sing, cry, and laugh all at the same time.
